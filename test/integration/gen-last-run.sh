# Regenerates test/integration/LAST-RUN (tagwright Testing Standard, task #548).
# The operator runs the harness (or at least the operator-run bucket) and then
# runs this to stamp the attestation with the current HEAD sha and today's date.
# A release job's check-last-run.sh asserts that sha equals the tag being
# published, so run this at the exact commit you will tag.
#
# It does NOT run the harness itself: it records that you did. Run the harness
# first (test/integration/run.sh), and for any operator-run bucket run those
# scenarios by hand against the real service, then edit the operator_run rows
# below to the results you observed. courier's operator_run is none today.
